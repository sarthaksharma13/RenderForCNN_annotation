# Render For CNN For Keypoint Generation


Original paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05641

This is a modification of the original paper to cater to our needs for our  IROS18 paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02057

The steps to run are present in https://github.com/sarthaksharma13/RenderForCNN_KeypointGeneration/Readme.txt. Advise is to go through that first. 
However as this is the data annotation pipeline which generates 3 views to be annotated. The sample views are present in data/view_distribution/Auto.txt
